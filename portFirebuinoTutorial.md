# Port Firebuino to META

While I added a fully working game ( [Firebuino Meta port!](https://gamebuino.com/creations/firebuino) thanks Jicehel, Krabbo, Sorunome and Steph in alphabethical order), this page
is actually meant to be a tutorial for how to port a game from Gamebuino Classic to Meta.
It addresses several things which are not part of the reference and might help aspiring game developers to do their first steps after finishing the academy.

Please note that this Tutorial is still in development and therefore many essential parts missing. So stay tuned for more updates!
